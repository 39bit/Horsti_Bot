# Horsti_Bot


Generates messages in chats based on an algorithm named after an insider joke.

It's similar to Markov chains, except that it uses characters (not words) and may also take some characters before into account.

By default, only sh-compatible shells and Unix-based systems are supported. espeak and opusenc are required for TTS: see the code under /horstitts.
